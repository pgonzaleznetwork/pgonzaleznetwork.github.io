         <p>Hi there</p>
<p>Thanks for your support using HappySoup.io.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, Heroku has been forcing more and more updates on the underlying database infrastructure that HappySoup relies on. Many of these updates require significant code and logic changes to the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These days I don&apos;t have the bandwidth or sometimes the technical expertise to keep up with the required updates; I&apos;m finding it more and more difficult.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I&apos;m keeping the service <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">offline</span> for the time being.</p>
<h4>If you need impact analysis or &quot;where is this used?&quot; functionality</h4>
<p>While I figure out if/when/how to bring the app back in a sustainable way, I recommend you use <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="https://app.salto.io/signup?defaultPlan=free&defaultApplication=salesforce&utm_source=HappySoup&utm_medium=referral">Salto&apos;s 100% free tier</a>. I&apos;ve worked with the team at Salto for the past year to ensure that many of the features you know and love about HappySoup are also available in Salto, free of cost.</p>
<p>The free-forever tier includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>&quot;where is this used?&quot; for any metadata type and any field (custom or standard)</li>
    <li>Full text search across all metadata, so you can find hardcoded IDs and email addresses</li>
    <li>Beautiful no-code metadata visualization&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>See it yourself</p>

 <h4>If you are a competitor</h4>
<p>If you are a competitor with a paid product in the impact analysis space, don&apos;t use this as an opportunity to say, &quot;See? This is why open-source products are bad, and you should pay for mine instead&quot;. Please be kind and use your own strengths to market your product, as I would hope it is good enough to stand on its own.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>If you really really want to keep using HappySoup</h4>
<p>You can always use HappySoup as a local app with Docker. The steps are relatively easy, and it&apos;s pretty stable</p>
<p>You can find a video with the instructions <a href="https://youtu.be/WQhz91JSl3o">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
